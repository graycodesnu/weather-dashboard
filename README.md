## Goals

The objective of this project was to develop a weather dashboard that fulfills the following requirements:
+ Upon searching for a city, the user should be able to view its present and upcoming weather conditions, which must be stored in local storage.
+ The dashboard must display the UV index and indicate the current conditions using color codes.
+ A five-day forecast for the specified city must be provided.
+ The user should be able to view their prior searches by clicking on the city stored in local storage, allowing them to access the weather conditions for that city once again.

## Results

After restarting this project once, I utilized the skills and knowledge I had acquired since Week 6 of the course. However, I encountered several bugs initially due to using similar names for multiple variables and classes. Once I resolved this issue, the majority of the application's features functioned well.

My primary challenge during the app development process was to retrieve the stored cities from local storage and display the relevant results. Additionally, many of the bugs were a result of my haphazard naming scheme and inadequate examination of the API documentation. This experience taught me the importance of being meticulous in my approach and thoroughly reviewing documentation before beginning any project.
